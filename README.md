###Restaurant Reservation and Dining App.
(Initially planned on a Universal Restaurant Ordering App.)

#Streamlined platfrom allowing the user to book a reservation at a restaurant at a certain time in advance, along with course menu.

Instead of having to call a restaurant to book a table in advance, allow user to check for occupancy of related food spots 
given a certain cuisine or dish a search bar. 
Compiles restaurant general restaurant data with a focus on menu and occupancy.
Similar to Yelp and GrubHub, but more direct communication with restaurants due to requiring occupancy space, reservation data, and items on the menu.

#Benefits: Give more business to restaurants, and allow them to better manage their occupancy, workload, and food preparation. 
#Allow users to factor in occupancy and possible wait times to their dining choice. 

#Future Endeavors: A.I. to give results based on user preference, recent searches, and GPS locationing.

#Users: Hungry people... People who don't want to wait an hour for a table.
